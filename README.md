## Test Automation Portfolio
This Portfolio includes samples of my work and coding style.
It currently includes an end to end test for adding a product to cart in https://amazon.com/ using Cypress.
More work to be added!

## About me
I'm a software quality engineer with experience in automated and manual testing,
my experience is mostly with using Cypress framework which includes adding, maintaining 
and optimizing automated test scrips, by focusing on creating tests which are stable, future-proof and have decent coverage.

I also have familiarity with other testing tools such as selenium, pytest and playwright.
